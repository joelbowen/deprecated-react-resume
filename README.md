## Dependencies

_An overview of the packages used to create this project, and why they were included_

**Global**
_You should not need any global dependencies, if you use npm scripts_

**Dependencies**

* [react] isomorphic React for content handling. I'm still learning React, and taking any opportunity that makes sense to do so.
  * [react-dom] The DOM handler for React, we're mainly concerned with the browser in this app.
* [babel-polyfill] Add ES6 features to our browsers. Do we really need this? Do you like surprises?

[react-dom]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom
[babel-polyfill]: https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-polyfill

**devDependencies**

* [autoprefixer] Add vendor prefixes to css, keep our fingers busy typing other things.
* css-loader, node-sass, postcss-loader, sass-loader, source-map-loader, style-loader, you can probably deduce these are chained together to make our screens drip with css (via webpack loaders)
* [babel] Give us that sweet sweet ES5 goodness that browsers love
* [eslint] In-editor warnings and compiler errors. Because I like to write accessible code
  * [eslint-config-airbnb] Opnionated javascript style and syntax. I'll admit, I wasn't originally on-board with comma dangles...
* [foundation-sites] Foundation comes with some smart flexy grids and utility classes. We're only using SCSS imports to selectively grab what we want and leave the rest - that's a lot of useless CSS we're leaving behind. That's also why this is a devDependency as it is compiled into our own CSS files.
* [gulp] A task-runner toolkit we're using to conduct our workflow, sits on top of things like webpack and passes sensible configurations.
  * require-dir, gulp-clean, gulp-copy, gulp-util...
* [webpack] For bundling, minifying, optimizing, and hyperbolizing
  * webpack-dev-server, file-loader, html-loader, html-webpack-plugin, json-loader...
